## 🗺 Two Modes — Choose Your Path

### ☢ DRIFTER MODE
*For survivors with a home node already running.*

Drifter mode connects your phone wallet to an existing CapStash Qt node running on your home network or PC. All blockchain data stays on your node — your phone is a remote control.

- Requires a running CapStash node (Qt wallet or daemon)
- Connects via **Tailscale VPN** for secure remote access
- No blockchain download on your phone
- Lightweight and fast

> Full Tailscale setup guide and node configuration details will be provided in an upcoming release. Stay tuned in Discord.

---

### ☢ WANDERER MODE
*For survivors who carry everything with them.*

Wanderer mode runs a **full CapStash node directly on your Android device**. No home node required — completely self-contained.

- Downloads and syncs the full CapStash blockchain on-device
- Generates a **BIP39 seed phrase** on first launch — write it down!
- Your seed phrase can restore your wallet on any device
- Includes integrated CPU miner
- Requires more storage and battery than Drifter mode

---

## 🔑 Seed Phrase — Your Most Important Backup

When setting up Wanderer mode for the first time, the wallet generates a **12-word BIP39 seed phrase**.

- **Write down all 12 words in order and store them safely**
- This is the only way to recover your wallet if you lose your device
- The wallet will verify you wrote it down before continuing
- Nobody can recover your seed phrase for you — not us, not anyone

> Already have a seed phrase? Use the **[ ALREADY HAVE A SEED PHRASE? RESTORE ]** option on the setup screen to restore your existing wallet.

---

## ⛏ Built-in Miner

Both modes include access to the **P.B.G. (Portable Blockchain Generator)** — the integrated CPU miner. Mine CAP directly from your phone and monitor your hashrate in real time.
